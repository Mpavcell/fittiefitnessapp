With this private project I attempted to create a website
based on the design from an existing template.

personal notes:

In the past when practicing HTML and CSS I would be losing
a lot of time on the design-part. Using an existing template
takes away the burden and time that goes into having to 
think about the design the aesthetics myself.  

This allows me to focus solely on practicing my code.

Because coding is still new to me I prefer to spend as much 
time as possible on the coding part and  spend a minimal
amount of time on field not related to coding.

In the future when I want to practice my code by building
practice-websites I will only be using already existing
templates or psd's as a visual example.

notes on project:

Building this website went very smoothly and I noticed
a significant increase in my understanding of HTML and CSS.

CSS Grid, which has been a bit confusing to me in the past, 
no longer causes any confusion.

I have still to get more used to Git. I do not use it properly.

I have to learn to name classes more properly.

A big point of attention for me are media queries. I struggled a lot writing proper media queries. Although for the last two pages ("features" and "contact") it went better, I had a very bad time writing proper media queries for the about page. They also seem to be very long and I think hard to read for anyone other than myself. 

I intend on making a few more practise websites before 
starting javaScript.

With this private project I attempted to recreate/copy an existing website without looking at the original source code and by just looking at the actual site in my browser. The existing website that I set out to recreate was a template I took from Themezy.com. Working like this enables me to focus solely on practicing my code, and focus less on design-specific matters.

DISCLAIMER: This website is a personal recreation of an already existing website template which is designed by Themezy.com. I do not claim ownership nor credit for the design and all rights belong to Themezy.com. I have used their template for educational purposes only and again do not claim it as my own.

Personal sidenotes on project:

I find that recreating websites without looking at the original code is excellent exercise for a beginning coder such as myself. Especially because there are many difficulty levels to challenge yourself with, depending on the complexity of the site one sets out to recreate.

Building this website went smoothly overall and I noticed a significant increase in my understanding of HTML and CSS.

CSS Grid, which has been a bit confusing to me in the past, no longer causes any confusion.

I have still to get more used to Git. I do not use it properly.

I have to learn to name classes more properly.

A big point of attention for me are media queries. I struggled a lot writing proper media queries. I had a very bad time writing proper media queries for the "about" page. They also seem to be very long and I suspect they are very hard to read for anyone other than myself.

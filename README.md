With this private project I attempted to create a website
based on the design from an existing template.

personal notes:

In the past when practicing HTML and CSS I would be losing
a lot of time on the design-part. Using an existing template
takes away the burden and time that goes into having to 
think about the design the aesthetics myself.  

This allows me to focus solely on practicing my code.

Because coding is still new to me I prefer to spend as much 
time as possible on the coding part and as least time possible
in other fields.

In the future when I want to practice my code by building
practice-websites I will only be using already existing
templates or psd's as a visual example.

notes on project:

Building this website went very smoothly and I noticed
a significant increase in my understanding of HTML and CSS.

CSS Grid, which has been a bit confusing to me in the past, 
no longer causes confusion.

I intend on making a few more practise websites before 
starting javaScript.

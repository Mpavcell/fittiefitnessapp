With this private project I attempted to recreate/copy an existing website without looking at the original source code and by just looking at the actual site in my browser. The existing website that I set out to recreate was a template I took from Themezy.com. Working like this enables me to focus solely on practicing my code, and focus less on design-specific matters.

I find that recreating websites without looking at the original code in the way I did here is excellent exercise for a beginning coder such as myself. 

DISCLAIMER: This website is a personal recreation of an already existing website template which is designed by Themezy.com. I do not claim ownership nor credit for the design and all rights belong to Themezy.com. I have used their template for educational purposes only and again do not claim it as my own.

Personal sidenotes on project:

Building this website went smoothly overall and I noticed a significant increase in my understanding of HTML and CSS.

CSS Grid, which has been a bit confusing to me in the past, no longer causes any confusion.

I have still to get more used to Git. I do not use it properly.

I have to learn to name classes more properly.

A big point of attention for me are media queries. I struggled a lot writing proper media queries. Although for the last two pages ("features" and "contact") it went better, I had a very bad time writing proper media queries for the about page. They also seem to be very long and I suspect they are hard to read for anyone other than myself.
